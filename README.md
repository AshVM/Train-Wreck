# OVERVIEW
Train Wreck is a short and sweet pixel game where you have to make the perfect coffee strong enough to wake you up!

# Why I Made This Project
This game was made in the span of 4 days for GMTK's 2025 Game Jam! I wanted to challenge and motivate myself to make a completed game within a short amount of time to increase my game development skils.

While I wasn't able to finish the game mechanics within the time period, I did place fairly high in the Art category after the voting period ended, which I'm particularly proud of.

# Features
- Cute Paw Cursor!!
- Coffee Making!
- Timer!
- **Stunning** visuals!
